      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The play on the FreeNAS name is intentional.  FreeNAS is an incredibly robust open-source network-attached storage software distribution based on FreeBSD and OpenZFS.  It also has correspondingly robust system requirements, and that in turn drives up the cost of ownership.</p>
      <p>WeeNAS, on the other hand, eschews all that fancy, high-performance hardware and ZFS filesystem.  WeeNAS is designed to run on a cheap Raspberry Pi 2 and uses a UFS filesystem on a common USB flash drive for storage.</p>

      <h2>Comparison to FreeNAS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is WeeNAS faster?  No.</li>
        <li>Is WeeNAS more fault tollerant?  No.</li>
        <li>Should you entrust your most precious files to WeeNAS?  No.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>So what is WeeNAS good for?</h2>
      <p>WeeNAS is basically a network attached flash drive.  Use it like a flash drive.  Plus, it's fun to say.</p>
      <p>Personally, I created WeeNAS as a way to keep a second copy of the documents and other files I have on my PC.  The hardware is so inexpensive, I'm seriously considering building another, identical system with a scheduled rsync between them.</p>
      <p>In other words, I'm banking on having multiple copies of my important files in case something goes sideways, rather than a one copy on a single super-robust system.</p>

      <h2>All of this and more!</h2>
      <p>WeeNAS is a do-it-yourself project lover's dream.  You supply the hardware, and WeeNAS guides you through the rest.</p>
      <p>WeeNAS will provide you with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customizable, automated install script to get you started quickly (work in progress)</li>
        <li>REST API for easy management of the system without needing the command-line (planning phase)</li>
        <li>Web-based administration system for day to day tasks (planning phase)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>System requirements</h2>
      <p>Here's what you'll need for hardware:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and suitable power supply</li>
        <li>32G micro-sd card compatible with Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>A USB flash drive compatible with Raspberry Pi *</li>
        <li>An Ethernet cable and home router with at least one free RJ-45 LAN connection</li>
        <li>Optional, externally-powered spinning disk for backups</li>
        <li>A client computer capable of attaching to SMB (CIFS) shares</li>
      </ul>
      <p>* The USB flash drive is where your home directories are stored.  Get the largest capacity that fits your budget.</p>


      <h2>Client Software</h2>
      <p>Here's what you'll need for software:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a> or similar tool to decompress the FreeBSD image file</li>
        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/" target="blank">Win32DiskImager</a> or similar software to write the image file to the SD card</li>
        <li><a href="https://angryip.org/" target="_blank">AngryIP Scanner</a> to help you find the DHCP address of your Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> or other SSH client to log in for the initial configuration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>The first step is to assemble your hardware and download the latest <a href="https://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">FreeBSD software image</a>.</p>
