    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The play on the <a href="https://www.freenas.org/" target="_blank">FreeNAS</a> name is intentional. FreeNAS is an
      incredibly robust open-source network-attached storage software distribution based on FreeBSD and OpenZFS. It also
      has correspondingly robust system requirements, and that in turn drives up the cost of ownership.</p>
    <p>WeeNAS, on the other hand, eschews all that fancy, high-performance hardware and sets its sites on the
      inexpensive Raspberry Pi with a UFS filesystem and common USB flash drive for storage.</p>

    <h2>Comparison to FreeNAS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Is WeeNAS faster? No.</li>
      <li>Is WeeNAS more fault tollerant? No.</li>
      <li>Should you entrust your most precious files to WeeNAS? No.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So what is WeeNAS good for?</h2>
    <p>WeeNAS is basically a network attached flash drive. Use it like a flash drive.</p>
    <p>Personally, I created WeeNAS as a way to keep a second copy of the documents and other files I have on my PC. The
      hardware is so inexpensive, I'm seriously considering building another, identical system with a scheduled rsync
      between them.</p>
    <p>In other words, I'm banking on having multiple copies of my important files in case something goes sideways,
      rather than a one copy on a single super-robust system.</p>

    <h2>DIY bliss and more!</h2>
    <p>WeeNAS is a do-it-yourself project lover's dream. You supply the hardware, and WeeNAS guides you through the
      rest.</p>
    <p>WeeNAS is just getting started, but already has these features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Install%20Guide.pdf">Easy to follow documentation</a> to get your system up and running.</li>
      <li>Customizable, automated install script to get you started quickly.</li>
      <li>REST API for easy management of the system without needing the command-line.</li>
      <li>Mobile friendly web-based administration page for day to day tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/users/DavesCodeMusings/projects/1">project board</a> to get an up to date
      status.</p>

    <h2>What are you waiting for?</h2>
    <p>Get started by assembling your Raspberry Pi hardware and gathering the required software. It's all outlined in <a
        href="Install%20Guide.pdf">the install guide</a>.</p>
