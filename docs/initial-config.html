    <h2>Initial Configuration</h2>
    <p>In this section, we'll be logging into the Raspberry Pi with PuTTY on a Windows client. We'll then run an
      initial set of commands that will get the Pi into a state for serving up files. Don't worry, all the commands
      are scripted out using a handy online configuration tool. Only minimal system admin experience is required.</p>
    <p>If you haven't plugged in the flash drive yet, do it now. Don't plug in any other storage devices at this time.
    </p>

    <h2>Find the IP Address of Your Raspberry Pi</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start up Angry IP Scanner.</li>
      <li>Click Tools > Fetchers, from the menu bar.</li>
      <li>Select MAC Vendor from Available Fetchers column and use the arrow to place move it to Selected Fetchers
        column.</li>
      <li>Run a scan of your home network's IP range.</li>
      <li>Look in the MAC Vendor column of the output for Raspberry Pi Foundation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is your Raspberry Pi's IP address. Remember it or write it down.</p>

    <h2>Connecting Via SecureShell (SSH)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start up PuTTY.</li>
      <li>Type your Raspberry Pi's IP address into the Host Name (or IP address) field.</li>
      <li>Click the Open button.</li>
      <li>Say yes to any messages about new host keys.</li>
      <li>Log in with the initial username/password combination of <em>freebsd/freebsd</em></li>
      <li>Change to the root user with the command 'su -'. Use the default password of <em>root</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Generate the Initial Configuration Script</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <a href="./install/index.html" target="_blank">WeeNAS Install web page</a>.</li>
      <li>Type in the required trusted username(s) for anyone who will be administering WeeNAS. Uppercase letters are
        okay, but accounts will be generated in lowercase.</li>
      <li>Regular users can be added for anyone using WeeNAS for file storage who will not be performing system
        administration.</li>
      <li>Set the timezone to a location close to you. This will keep date-time stamps consistent with client machines.
      </li>
      <li>Browse the remaining options if you wish to customize the setup further.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All of the commands you need to configure WeeNAS are now displayed on the green screen monitor of the installer
      web page. Keep this information handy or simply leave the configuration web page open for later reference.</p>

    <h2>Configuring FreeBSD</h2>
    <p>If you are familiar with Unix on the command-line, you may want to open a file on the Raspberry Pi, copy all of
      the commands to it, and run it as a single script. You can also copy the commands, one at a time, from the
      installer page and paste them into the PuTTY window.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure you are logged in as root by running the command 'whoami'.</li>
      <li>Run each of the commands from the install script on the Raspberry Pi via PuTTY.</li>
      <li>Pay close attention to the last command. It will display the randomly assigned passwords for the trusted
        users. <em>Remember these passwords!</em></li>
      <li>When all of the commands have been run, you can log out of PuTTY with the command 'exit'. If you configured a
        static IP address, restart with 'shutdown -r now'.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Verify Access for Trusted User</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use PuTTY to once again connect to the Raspberry Pi.</li>
      <li>Log in with the first trusted user and the random password displayed by the previous steps.</li>
      <li>Use the command 'su -' to switch to the root user.</li>
      <li>This is a good time to change the root password using the 'passwd' command.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Verifying Access to CIFS (Samba) Shares</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open up This PC or File Explorer.</li>
      <li>In the left side list, locate This PC.</li>
      <li>Right-click on This PC and choose 'Add a network location' from the list of choices on the context menu.</li>
      <li>More to come...</li>
    </ol>
