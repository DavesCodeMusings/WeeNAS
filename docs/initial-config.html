    <h2>Initial Configuration</h2>
    <p>In this section, we'll be using a Windows client computer to log into the Raspberry Pi using PuTTY and run an
      initial set of commands to get the Pi into a state for serving up files. Don't worry, all the commands are
      scripted out using a handy online configuration tool. Minimal brain cells are required.</p>
    <p>If you haven't plugged in the flash drive yet, do it now.</p>

    <h2>Find the IP Address of Your Raspberry Pi</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start up Angry IP Scanner.</li>
      <li>Click Tools > Fetchers, from the menu bar.</li>
      <li>Select MAC Vendor from Available Fetchers column and use the arrow to place move it to Selected Fetchers column.</li>
      <li>Run a scan of your home network's IP range.</li>
      <li>Look in the MAC Vendor column of the output for Raspberry Pi Foundation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is your Raspberry Pi's IP address. Remember it or write it down.</p>

    <h2>Connecting Via SecureShell (SSH)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start up PuTTY.</li>
      <li>Type your Raspberry Pi's IP address into the Host Name (or IP address) field.</li>
      <li>Click the Open button.</li>
      <li>Say yes to any messages about new host keys.</li>
      <li>Log in with the initial username/password combination of <em>freebsd/freebsd</em></li>
      <li>Type su - and use the default root password of <em>root</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Generate the Initial Configuration Script</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <a href="./install/index.html" target="_blank">WeeNAS Install web page</a>.</li>
      <li>Type in the required trusted username(s) for anyone who will be administering WeeNAS.</li>
      <li>Regular users can be added for anyone using WeeNAS for file storage who is not a system admin.</li>
      <li>Browse the remaining options if you wish to customize the setup.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All of the commands you need to configure WeeNAS are displayed on the green screen monitor of the installer web page.</p>

    <h2>Configuring the Raspberry Pi</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If you are familiar with Unix on the command-line, you may want to open a file on the Raspberry Pi, copy all of the commands to it, and run it as a script.</li>
      <li>You can also copy the commands, one at a time, from the installer page and paste them into the PuTTY window.</li>
      <li>Pay close attention to the last command.  It will display the randomly assigned password for the first trusted user. <em>Remember this password!</em></li>
      <li>When all of the commands have been run, you can log out of PuTTY with the command 'exit'.  If you changed to a static IP address, restart with 'shutdown -r now'.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Verify SSH Connectivity</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use PuTTY to once again connect to the Raspberry Pi.</li>
      <li>Log in with the first trusted user and the random password displayed by the previous steps.</li>
    </ol>
