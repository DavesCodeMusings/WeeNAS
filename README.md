# WeeNAS
In this directory you will find
* install.sh
* weenas_api.js

For first-time installation, run install.sh from this directory as follows:

./install.sh

This will install neccessary components using the FreeBSD pkg system and also
configure weenas_api.js as a system service.

Once installation is complete, configuration is done from a web browser.  Just
go to this host's name or IP address at port 9000.  Like this:

http://<hostname or IP>:9000
