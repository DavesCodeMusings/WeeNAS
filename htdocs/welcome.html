  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    If this is your first visit to the WeeNAS admin tool, you'll want to start by setting up some users. User accounts
    and system access can be managed by clicking the blue circle containing the two silhouettes. There is a bulk account
    creation feature that lets you create a dozen or so users at once just by entering their login names.
  </p>

  <h1>System Health</h1>
  <p>
    The WeeNAS admin tool is designed to communicate system health with just a glance. There are five health indicators
    on the left side of the screen (or top if you are on a mobile device.) From top down (or right to left) these icons
    represent the system hardware, storage devices, system services, shared directories, and user accounts. Each icon
    has a health indicator next to it with one of four statuses.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:5vmin;">
    <img src="dialog-positive.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Everything is alright.
    <br>
    <img src="dialog-warning.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Something needs your attention.
    <br>
    <img src="dialog-information.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Information is available, but nothing's wrong.
    <br>
    <img src="dialog-question.svg" style="vertical-align: middle;"> There was a problem obtaining the status.
  </p>
  <p>
    WeeNAS is built to be self-healing, so it's rare that you should ever see anything other than a green check or a
    blue i.

  <h1>Credits</h1>
  <p>
    WeeNAS would not be possible without some great open source hardware and software projects to build upon. For a list
